Simple-WebRTC-Chat
==================

A super simple WebRTC chat implementation that uses openkeyval.org as a signaling server.

One person creates a room and passes along the room number to a friend.
The friend uses the room number to join the chat.

This doesn't require a server. It works out of your own file system (using file:///blah in the browser).
Only supports chat between two people.
