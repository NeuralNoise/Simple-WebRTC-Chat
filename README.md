Simple-WebRTC-Chat
==================

## This doesn't work anymore as Openkeyval.org is no longer up.

A super simple WebRTC chat implementation that uses openkeyval.org as a signaling server.

One person creates a room and passes along the room number to a friend.  
The friend uses the room number to join the chat.
 
This doesn't require a server. It works out of your own file system (using file:///blah in the browser).  
Only supports chat between two people.
